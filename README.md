# World_Weather_Analysis

Overview

Travel offers a very upclose and personal experience of cultures around the world. Weather conditions can make or break your vacation! Use our app to map out your trip to ensure you are up to date on weather conditions during your trip. Just click on a rep marker on the map and gather information about the nearest Hotel, city name, country, current weather, and max temperature.

The purpose of this project is to collect, analyze and visualize weather data across cities worldwide and to provide travelers with a tool that will allow them to determine their travel destination based on weather conditions.

##Weather Database

    -- Latitude and longitude
    -- Maximum temperature
    -- Percent humidity
    -- Percent cloudiness
    -- Wind speed
    -- Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)
    
  #This data was exported into a dataframe and exported to csv file 'WeatherPy_Database.csv'

##Vacation Search

  #You can click any red marker on the map to view the nearest hotel, city name, country, current weather, and max temperature.
